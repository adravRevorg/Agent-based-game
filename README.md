#An agent based game

Modeled and simulated a user-interactive agent based game between fish flock and oil, in a fluid. Modeled fish boids, dye spread, a 2D incompressible semi-lagrangian fluid, and a system including all.
Fluid simulation is a 2D Incompressible Semi-Lagrangian Fluid. The fish flock as per certain flocking rules. They also release a life-saving, oil-killing dye which gets spread into the fluid, as per fluid simulation rules. The user can add oil into the fluid, which can kill fish. The flocking parameters can be changed live, and there are several parameters like spread rate, fade rate, health loss and gain, etc which make this game an equal-probability win. The score is shown every time, and as seen on many runs, both oil or fish have the chance to win. The fish get affected by fluid velocity too. Also, there is an algorithm added for fishes to detect dye hotspots and try to steer away.
